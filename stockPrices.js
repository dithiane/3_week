Instructions
This challenge, youâ€™ll write a function, called best, that returns the maximum profit possible for buying-and-selling a stock.

The best function will be given an array of stock prices in the order they happened throughout the day.

It should return the maximum possible profit on the stock for that day.

For example, with the following prices, our best option would have been to buy the stock at $10 and sell it at $22. So the profit would be $12:

best([15, 10, 20, 22, 1, 9])
12
Here are some more examples with positive profit:

best([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
// 4 - buy at $1, sell at $5

best([2, 3, 10, 6, 4, 8, 1])
// 8 - buy at $2, sell at $10

best([7, 9, 5, 6, 3, 2])
// 2 - buy at $7, sell at $9

best([0, 100])
// 100 - buy at $0, sell at $100
If no profit is possible, return $0:

best([5, 4 , 3, 2, 1])
// 0

best([100])
// 0

best([100, 0])
// 0
*/
const best = (prices) => {
    let minPrice = prices[0];
    let maxProfit = 0;
    let min, max, profit
  
    for (const price of prices) {
      minPrice = Math.min(minPrice, price);
      maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, price - minPrice);
      if (profit !== maxProfit) {
        min = minPrice
        max = price
      }
      profit = maxProfit
    }
  
    return maxProfit <=0 ? '$0' : `${profit} - buy at $${min}, sell at $${max}` ;
  };

console.log(best([15, 10, 20, 22, 1, 9]))
console.log(best([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
console.log(best([2, 3, 10, 6, 4, 8, 1]))
console.log(best([7, 9, 5, 6, 3, 2]))
console.log(best([0, 100]))
console.log(best([5, 4 , 3, 2, 1]))
console.log(best([100]))
console.log(best([100, 0]))
